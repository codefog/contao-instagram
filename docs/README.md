# Instagram â€“ Documentation

## Prerequisites

You must own an [Instagram business account](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522) to be able to use this extension and display the feed on your website.

## Create an Instagram app

First of all you have to create the Instagram app. For that please follow the [official Getting Started guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/create-a-meta-app-with-instagram)
up until point 6 (inclusive).

Then, it is important to configure all app URIs, as described in Step 9 (Set up business login):

- Valid OAuth Redirect URIs
- Deauthorize Callback URL
- Data Deletion Request Callback URL

you have to enter your domain name + `/_instagram/auth` suffix (without a trailing slash!), e.g. `https://domain.tld/_instagram/auth`:

Here you should also copy the *Instagram App ID* and *Instagram App Secret* keys to your clipboard.


## Create a frontend module

Now go to the Contao backend and create the `Instagram` front end module. Fill in the necessary data, 
check the `Request access token and update feed` checkboxbox and save the record.

If you have configured your app properly, you should now see the screen prompting you for the authorization.
Click the button to authorize yourself for your app and you should be taken back to the Contao backend.

Please ensure that the `Instagram access token` is now filled in. You can now safely add the module to the page.


## Template data

The displayed template data out of box is very simple, as only the images are displayed. If you need more information,
you should check out the `$this->items` and `$this->user` variables.

You can do that by dumping the variables inside `mod_cfg_instagram.html5` template:

```php
<?php $this->showTemplateVars(); ?>
```


## Cache configuration

By default, the Instagram data is cached for 1 hour. You can change it by adding the below configuration to your
`config/config.yml` (or `app/config/config.yml` for Contao 4.4) file:

```yaml
codefog_instagram:
    access_token_ttl: 86400 # access token local time to live after which Contao will make a request to refresh the token, in seconds
    cache_ttl: 3600 # feed data cache local time to live, in seconds
``` 

Afterwards you may need to rebuild the app cache, e.g. using Contao Manager!


## Cron job

As of version 2.0, there is a cron job that refreshes the access token once per day


## Data restrictions

Before you report any bugs regarding the missing Instagram feed data, be sure that you have read the official
documentation that contains information about the data you can obtain from the API:

1. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/

> As of version 2.0 of the extension and changes in Instagram API, it is no longer possible to filter media files
> by a #hashtag. This option has been dropped in version 2.0.0 of the extension.


## Troubleshooting

If at some point the extension does not work make sure to check the system logs. Please open an issue on Github
if your error is not listed below.

### cURL error 3: <url> malformed 

This error can happen occasionally and cause the feed to appear and disappear from the page (see #22). It is likely 
caused by SSL verification failure. To fix this problem, you should contact your hosting provider. Another solution 
would be to skip SSL verification in the frontend module settings (not recommended).

### Error message: Insufficient developer role

Go to `Facebook Developers > App Roles > Roles` and click the `Add Instagram Testers` button. 
From the search list of the Instagram accounts, find your account you would like to connect.

Then, log in to your Instagram account and go to the `Settings > Apps and websites > Tester Invites` and accept
the invitation.

After that, request the access token from within Contao once again.
